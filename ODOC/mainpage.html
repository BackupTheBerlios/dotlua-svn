        <h3>The dotLua project:</h3>
        <p>dotLua is a C# class library which allows C# 2.0 to interact with the LUA scripting engine. It bases on the original, but
        slightly modified, LUA C API. LUA is a leightweight, fast, structual scripting language.</p>
        
        <h3>Core features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to use interface. But it retains the power of the native C LUA API.</li>
            <li>C# callbacks for LUA: LUA calls C# and reverse.</li>
            <li>You can also write LUA libraries in form of C# static classes.</li>
            <li>Benefit from a small and lightweight .NET class library.</li>
        </ul>
