 1. What do I need to do to get dotLua to work?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 If you downloaded the sources you need to compile it. But if you downloaded
 the binary package you just have to import the dotLua assembly and always
 keep the lua_stdcall binary library by it's side.
 
 
 2. What is the lua_stdcall.dll?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Read LUA\README.TXT for further information.
 
 
 3. Where is the source code of lua_stdcall.dll?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 It's not shipped with this package to minimize size. But may download it from
 the BerliOS project page.
